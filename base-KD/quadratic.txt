['<|begin_of_text|>Derive the quadratic formula from the equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0. Derivation of the Quadratic Formula. To derive the quadratic formula, we start by solving the general quadratic equation. The general quadratic equation is ax 2 + bx + c = 0. The general quadratic equation is ax 2 + bx + c = 0. We start by isolating the x 2 term. Divide both sides by a. We start by isolating the x 2 term. Divide both sides by a. We then subtract c/a from both sides. We then subtract c/a from both sides. We then divide both sides by b/a. We then divide both sides by b/a. We then take the square root of both sides. We then take the square root of both sides. We then solve for x. We then solve for x. This is the quadratic formula. This is the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is a general formula that can be used to solve any quadratic equation. The quadratic formula is a general formula that can be used to solve any quadratic equation. The quadratic formula is a general formula that can be used to solve any quadratic equation.
