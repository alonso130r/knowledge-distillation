What is proof by induction? [duplicate]\nProof by induction is a method of proof used to show that a statement is true for all positive integers. It is a type of constructive proof.\nThe basic steps are as follows:\n1. Prove the base case: Prove the statement is true for n = 1. This is the starting point.\n2. Assume the statement is true for n = k. This is the induction hypothesis. Assume the statement is true for the kth positive integer.\n3. Use the induction hypothesis to prove that the statement is true for n = k + 1. This is the inductive step.\nIf the statement is true for n = 1, and it can be shown that if it is true for n = k, then it is also true for n = k + 1, then the statement is true for all positive integers.\n\nFor example, consider the statement " 2^n is always even."\nThe base case would be to show that n = 1. In this case, 2^n is 2, and that is even.\nNext is the induction hypothesis: assume the statement is true for n = k, i.e. 2^k is even.\nNow to use this hypothesis to prove that the statement is true for n = k + 1. We need to show that 2^k is even is true. 2^k is even, and if you multiply a positive number by 2, it also is even. So 2^k + 1 = 2^(k + 1) is even.\nTherefore, the statement that 2^n is always even is true for n = 1, and true for n = k + 1 if true for n = k. By proof by induction, the statement is true for all positive integers. Therefore, the statement is true.  Proof by induction is the most powerful method of proof in the world, for some. [duplicate]\nI am sure you are aware of the method of proof by induction. This is an example of how to prove that 2^n is always even. The method is also used to prove the statement that 2^n is always a positive number. Therefore, it is used in some other mathematical statements. The method of proof by induction is used for only some of the mathematical statements that need to be proven. The method of proof by induction is not used for statements that involve other things that are not positive integers. \nThe method of proof by induction is not used for all of the mathematical statements. Therefore, there is some other method of proof that is used. The method of proof by induction is not used for the statement that the number of positive integers that are greater than 1 is a finite number. This is because the number of positive integers that are greater than 1 is not a finite number. This is because the number of positive integers that are greater than 1 is not a finite number.
